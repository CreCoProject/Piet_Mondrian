# Piet_Mondrian
In this Project I will show you different Codes with which you can
Create different Images in the kind of the famous Dutch Painter Piet Mondrian.
I find that Piet Mondrians Work is verry good for Convertion to Computer
Art.
One of the main Ideas of Piet Mondrian is the Generalisation of Art.
This means that there are no Individuell Moments in the Process of Doing
Art. Even this we can see in Computer Programms. Here the Computer
follows a Generalisated Concept of Work the Computer Programm.
In my Style of Individualised Multiple Art Work. This abstract Process
of Creating Art by a Computer Programm became back a Indivduel Aspect
by the Random Creation and the Choosing or called Supervision trougth 
the User.
